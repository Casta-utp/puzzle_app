# puzzle_app
This project implements artificial intelligence search algorithms to solve two classic problems: the 8-Puzzle and the Maze Solver. The application, built using Python and the Kivy framework, provides an interactive interface where users can select algorithms like BFS, DFS, A*, as well as heuristics such as Manhattan Distance and Linear Conflict.
